Creative Way of "Emulating" Deep Thought from The Hitchhiker's Guide series

**Introduction**

Deep Thought calculated *The answer to life the universe and everything* in a period of 7.5 million years, the solution was **`42`**

The challenge was to write code that took approx `75` seconds to calculate, and presenting the number **42** as output.

N.B. The number 42 had to be calculated somehow (random numbers, whatever you prefer), and not just hard-coded in my script.  

I also couldn't use `sleep` or equivalent functions, so I had to be inventive.
